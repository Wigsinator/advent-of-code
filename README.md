# Wigsinator's Advent of Code Repository

In previous years, I've made a whole new repository for advent of code, but this year I figured I might as well take the leap and just put it all in one.

For 2024, I'm going to be doing Advent of Code in Go, because I've been meaning to learn the language. I also plan on doing a writeup of each day as I go through them, and will be posting these writeups to my personal blog.

Many of the scripts I'm starting out with are taken with deep thanks from [Alex Chao's Advent of Code Go](https://github.com/alexchao26/advent-of-code-go) repository.
